✅ PROJECT OVERVIEW (Say this in the interview)

“My project is an Expense Tracker built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to add income and expenses, and it instantly calculates the total income, total expenses, and the remaining balance.
All the transactions are displayed in a table with date, type, and amount.
The UI is clean and responsive, and the entire calculation and updating of data happens dynamically using JavaScript DOM manipulation.
Right now, the project works fully on the frontend, and I’m planning to add local storage in the next version so that the data is saved permanently.”

This is your core explanation.
If the interviewer understands this, 50% job done.

✅ EXPECTED QUESTIONS (Very common)

1. What is the purpose of your Expense Tracker?
“It helps users track their daily income and expenses and gives them a real-time balance.”

2. Why did you choose HTML, CSS, and JS?
“Because this project is UI-based and lightweight. Vanilla JavaScript is enough for dynamic updates.”

3. How does your app calculate balance?
“Every time a new transaction is added, I recalculate totalIncome, totalExpense, and balance using simple JS functions.”

4. How do you add transactions dynamically?
“I capture input values with JavaScript, store them temporarily in an array, and update the UI using DOM manipulation.”

5. What features are you planning to add?
“I plan to add local storage to save transactions permanently, and maybe graphs for visualization.”

✅ COMMON QUESTIONS (Most interviewers ask these)

6. What challenges did you face?
“Handling dynamic totals and keeping the UI clean were challenges. I solved them by using reusable JS functions and better CSS layout.”

7. What was your role?
“I built the complete UI and implemented all JavaScript logic.”

8. How do you validate inputs?
“I ensure amount is positive, date is selected, and type is chosen. Invalid inputs can be handled with JS alerts.”

9. Why is this project useful?
“It helps people manage their finances easily without complex apps.”

10. Did you follow any structure in your code?
“Yes, I separated HTML structure, CSS styling, and JS logic clearly.”

✅ UNEXPECTED / TRICKY QUESTIONS

These are asked to test your thinking ability.

11. How will you store data permanently?
“I will integrate LocalStorage first, and later I can switch to a backend like Firebase or Node.js.”

12. How will you scale the project for many users?
“I’ll move data to a backend database like MongoDB and add login for each user.”

13. How will you make it secure if financial data is added?
“By using authentication, HTTPS, and enforcing encrypted data storage.”

14. How would you handle thousands of transactions in the table?
“Use pagination, search filters, and optimize DOM updates.”

15. What if two users use the same browser?
“I can create separate user profiles using local storage or backend authentication.”

✅ VERY RARE QUESTIONS (But sometimes asked)

16. How will you make the UI more responsive?
“By using media queries, flexible layouts, and percentage-based widths.”

17. Why didn’t you use React?
“For a small project, vanilla JS is faster and simpler. But if the project grows, I can migrate to React.”

18. How will you add charts?
“By using a library like Chart.js to visualize income vs expenses.”

19. How does data flow in your project?
“User input → JS captures data → JS updates totals → JS updates table → UI displays results.”

20. What would you improve in the next version?
“Storage, charts, editing transactions, and filtering.”
