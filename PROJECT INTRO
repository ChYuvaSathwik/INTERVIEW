“My project is Python Voice Assistant.
It is a Python-based desktop assistant that interacts with the user using voice commands.
The assistant can perform tasks like playing YouTube videos, telling the current time, fetching information from Wikipedia, opening applications like Chrome and VS Code, and telling programming jokes.

I built it using Python libraries and modules:

speech_recognition – converts voice into text

pyttsx3 – converts text into speech

pywhatkit – plays YouTube videos automatically

wikipedia – fetches summaries from Wikipedia

pyjokes – tells programming jokes

datetime – gets the current time

os & sys – built-in modules to open applications and exit the program

The assistant works step by step: it listens to the user’s voice, converts it into text, checks which command it matches, executes the task, and responds using voice.
It continuously listens until the user says ‘exit’ or ‘stop’.

Overall, this project helped to learn real-time voice interaction, Python automation, and handling multiple libraries together.”
