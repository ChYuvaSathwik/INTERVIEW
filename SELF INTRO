SELF INTRO

Sir, my name is Sathwik Chinta, and I am currently pursuing my final year of Electronics and Communication Engineering at KL University.
During college, I worked on several projects like a Python-based Voice Assistant, an Expense Tracker Web App, and a Number Guessing Game. 
These gave me hands-on experience in coding and teamwork. I’m passionate about solving problems using technology, 
and I’m always curious to learn new tools and skills. Outside of studies, I enjoy watching movies and exploring new tech tools,
which helps me stay creative and balanced.
